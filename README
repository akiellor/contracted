Contracted
==========================================================
Contracted provides a few tools to describe HTTP Responses
and HTTP Response bodies.

A few cucumber steps are implemented which faciliated this
description.


JSON Description Grammar
----------------------------------------------------------
The JSON Description Grammar is a superset of JSON which 
adds some wildcards allowing you to describe the parts of
the response your interested in. Example:

{
  "message": {
    "text": ...,
    ...
  }
}

This says that the 'message' object has an entry with key
'text' and any number of other entries.

The cucumber features provide more examples.

The grammar is based on the JSON parser from the following
